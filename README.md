# ISML-MDE
A Model Driven Environment for the ISML Language

## Introduction
ISML stands for "Information Systems Modeling Language". Its long-term vision is to become a domain-specific language to specify information systems. In its current form, ISML is able to specify software systems based on the MVC pattern. ISML provides __pages__ to represent views, __controllers__ to specify the flow of pages and user interaction, and __entities__, to specify persistent elements in the system. In addition to MVC concepts, ISML provides __services__ that can encapsulate existing components or services in a system and can be utilized from __controllers__.

ISML also provides several code generators to transform ISML models into implementations on different platforms (e.g., Java EE, Android, PHP).
